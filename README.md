**Project Overview**

This project is a simple **Student Management System** developed in **Java**. It demonstrates essential **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts**, including:

- **Encapsulation**: The `Student` class has private fields with public getter and setter methods.
- **Abstraction**: The program hides implementation details from the user and provides a simple menu-driven interface.
- **Inheritance**: (If extended in the future) A base `Person` class could be used for both students and teachers.
- **Polymorphism**: Methods like `addStudent()` and `removeStudent()` operate on different student objects dynamically.

**Features**
- Add new students with a unique ID.
- View all registered students.
- Remove students based on their ID.
- Simple text-based menu navigation.

**How to Run the Project**
1. Install Java Development Kit (JDK) from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
2. Use an IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, or NetBeans) or a text editor like Notepad++.
3. Copy and paste the Java code into a file named `StudentManagementSystem.java`.
4. Open a terminal, navigate to the file location, and compile the program using:
   ```bash
   javac StudentManagementSystem.java
   ```
5. Run the program:
   ```bash
   java StudentManagementSystem
   ```
6. Follow the on-screen menu to add, view, or remove students.

**Conclusion**
This project provides a basic understanding of **OOP concepts** in Java while managing student records. It can be extended by adding features like **file storage, database integration, and GUI-based management**.
